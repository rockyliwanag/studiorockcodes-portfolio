For <b>Project 1</b> of my GA Bootcamp. I picked Blackjack as my game. Given the timeline we were assigned, I decided to do a game I am most familiar with and I know I could handle. Before choosing the project, I knew there were still a lot of things I needed to learn and understand, and thinking back to it, this was the perfect difficulty for my level.

Blackjack as simple as it is when played, has a lot of variables that can make developing tha game a challenge. The biggest is having the Aces hold 2 values that can be modified, during gameplay, to a value of either 1 or 11. This is what I found to be the biggest frustration when building my game.

## Getting Started

<ol>
<li>The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.</li>
<li>Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.</li>
<li>Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.</li>
<li>To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.</li>
<li>If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.</li>
<li>If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack.</li>
<li>Dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<ul>
<li>To start the game, all you need to do is click Deal.</li>
<li> After 2 cards have been dealt, you can either click hit to deal more cards. Careful not to go over 21 or you bust.</li>
<li> Click the Stay button if you are happy with your cards and let the dealer make its moves. Good Luck!</li>
</ul>

    by a split.
