## Next Steps (Icebox)

1. My icebox include having only registered users be the only one to add books and reviews.

2. Have registered users view all the comments that they added on their profile page.

3. Search function for existing books to add reviews.

4. Be able to borrow books from user to user.

5. Add function for users to upload book cover art.

6. Sort Fiction/Non-fiction and in Alphabetical order.
