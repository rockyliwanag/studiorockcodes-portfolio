This was a recent project that a family friend asked for some help. She makes candles and mostly markets it as event giveaways.

She had a tight budget, and wanted to use Wix. I used a Wix template for this design and added some stock images.

This is still an ongoing project, and we're in the middle of going through the design on what she would like to keep and change.
