## Project Details

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
  I was hired by a content creative company, [Rebrand
  Creatives](http://www.rebrandlifestyle.com/), to create a CMS website for
  their client. The White Home in South Carolina hosts corporate events and
  weddings. They needed a website to show a gallery of photos of different
  events that they had and they also want to show a calendar of events they have
  scheduled.
