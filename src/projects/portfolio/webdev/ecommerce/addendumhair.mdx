import AhGallery from '/src/components/galleries/AhGallery'

## Project Details

This company specializes in marketing hair extensions to salons and licensed hair stylists.

This WordPress project was referred over to me to get their purchased theme working. The project was halfway done, with most of the content already managed.<br/>

To make sure I do not destroy any data already created, I made a local dev environment.
I was able to update and test compatibility on the local environment before making
any final changes. I quoted a 3 day work and delivered on time.
