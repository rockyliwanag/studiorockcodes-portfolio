## Project Details

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
  Instapass is a web application that uses ticketevolution's API to find event
  tickets nationwide. The web application is built using the MERN stack as its
  web development framework, and integrated Braintree as its payment solutions.
  <br />
  <br />
  Initially, I started as a UX/UI graphic artist and created Sketch mock-ups that
  were used on InvisionApp to create a clickable prototype. Since I was able to build
  a relationship with the client, I was assigned as a Product Owner and facilitated
  expressing what the client needs with outsourced programmers, and became the intermediary
  between the client and dev team.
